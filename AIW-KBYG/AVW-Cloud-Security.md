1. Exercise 2 Step6

   If attendee is not able to view th **recommendations/security controls** in the Security Center, attendee can continue to the next exercise as they are independent and verify this after some time. 
   
   It could take up-to 24 hours for all the recommendations to show up. And it is possible that during the lab time this may not show up â€“ which is the case sometimes.
