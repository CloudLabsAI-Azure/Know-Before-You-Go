#### Known issues in Lab Steps 
    
#### 1. Usage of personal GitHub accounts:
The attendees will need to have their own GitHub accounts /will have to create one during the ongoing lab (if not available already). Since provisioning of GitHub accounts for n number of users is not possible, the attendees are required to use their personal GitHub account. For ensuring account securities, we are using the “GitHub personal access token” so as the users don’t have to use their passwords while performing lab. The attendees can also delete the “GitHub personal access token” once they have performed the lab.
