#### Module-2-Exploring-Azure-Security-Center

1. Exercise 2 Step6:

   If attendee is not able to view th **recommendations/security controls** in the Security Center, attendee can continue to the next exercise as they are independent and verify this after some time. 
   
   It could take up-to 24 hours for all the recommendations to show up. And it is possible that during the lab time this may not show up â€“ which is the case sometimes. 
   
1. Azure API issue: 

   - Due to recent changes in Azure api's, azure API's are taking some additional time to fetch the details of the resources . The validation steps might fail initially for the lab, if you re-run the steps again after 30-45 minutes later then it will succeed if there will be no configuration related issue with lab steps you performed.
