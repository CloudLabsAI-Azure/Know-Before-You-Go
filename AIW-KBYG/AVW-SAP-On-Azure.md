### Known issues in Lab Steps 

1. #### Module 3: Cloud Operations, Governance, Security

     - Module 3 has predeployed and preconfigured SAP HANA resources, attendees will be reviewing the pre-configured resources and perform few steps. Some of the steps are designed as **read-only** and not to be performed as a part of this module.

1. #### Azure API issue: 

   - Due to recent changes in Azure api's, azure API's are taking some additional time to fetch the details of the resources . The validation steps might fail initially for the lab, if you re-run the steps again after 30-45 minutes later then it will succeed if there will be no configuration related issue with lab steps you performed.
