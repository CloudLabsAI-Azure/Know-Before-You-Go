   - Due to recent changes in Azure api's, azure API's are taking some additional time to fetch the details of the resources . The validation steps might fail initially for the lab, if you re-run the steps again after 30-45 minutes later then it will succeed if there will be no configuration related issue with lab steps you performed.
