### Know issues in Lab Steps

1. Issue with Ubuntu K8s VM Start:

	**ubuntu-k8s failed to restore**
	
	Solution: Right click on the **ubuntu-k8s vm** from the Hyper-V Manager and then click on Delete Saved State and then start the VM from the Hyper-V Manager


1. If **LabVM** opens on full screen, then you can **Restore Down** the window.
