### Issue related to Azure Migrate GUI in Exercise 2 and Exercise 3: 

In Exercise 2: Task 2 and Exercise 3 after completing the migration of the app service, we are unable to view the discovered web servers, assessment websites and migrated website in Azure Migrate overview page. It is an issue with Azure Migrate product GUI, we have engaged MS support team for the issue they are looking into it and we don't have ETA on this from MS team yet.
However servers are discovered and website also assessed in actual and you can proceed with the next steps, you will be getting all required things in next steps without any issue. This is the GUI issue and won't affect any lab functionality.
